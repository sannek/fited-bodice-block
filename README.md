# Basic Fitted Bodice Block

WIP - basic bodice for FreeSewing. Maybe for future full patterns?

## To Do

- finish back draft (darts)
- true up dart legs for side and waist darts
- rotate / shorten darts for actually sewable block

## Fitting improvements

- handle very large or very small full bust / overbust differences.
- allow more fine-tuning of things like armhole depth / back width etc
- look at branching drafts for specific issues, like long back / large cup size
